# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Codex and other coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project

AtomicConnection is a Unity project built with Unity `6000.4.4f1` + URP. Game design is documented in [AtomicConnection_GDD.md](AtomicConnection_GDD.md). Infrastructure is still template-derived; `Gameplay/Units` and `Gameplay/Enemies` are minimal example features used to exercise lifecycle and DI patterns until production gameplay replaces them.

## Build & Run

This is a Unity project - there is no CLI build command. Open in Unity `6000.4.4f1` and press Play. Scenes must be loaded in order: `Bootstrap -> MainMenu -> Gameplay` (configured in Build Settings).

No project-owned automated tests exist under `Assets/_Project`. Manual validation is done by running the game in the Editor.

## Repository Rules

- Keep Unity `.meta` files together with their assets and scripts.
- Do not edit generated folders: `Library`, `Temp`, `Obj`, `Logs`, `UserSettings`, `.vs`, `.idea`, or IDE caches.
- Avoid editing generated solution/project files (`*.sln`, `*.csproj`) unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Prefer changes inside `Assets/_Project` for project code. Treat `Assets/Plugins`, `Assets/NaughtyAttributes`, `Assets/TextMesh Pro`, and imported packages as vendor code unless asked otherwise.
- Do not revert unrelated local changes. This repository may contain user, IDE, or Unity-generated changes in progress.

## Architecture

### Lifecycle reference lock

Lifecycle, state machine, DI, scene loading, UI flow, and gameplay loop work is reference-locked to `ecs-survivors`.
Resolve its local path from `REFERENCES.local.md` first when present, otherwise from `REFERENCES.md`.
If neither file contains a valid local path, ask the user for the current `ecs-survivors` checkout path before doing lifecycle work.

Implemented AtomicConnection architecture is the first source of truth. When a rule, pattern, or working example already exists in `AGENTS.md` or `Assets/_Project`, follow this project even if it intentionally differs from `ecs-survivors`.

Use `ecs-survivors` only for new architecture/lifecycle decisions that are not already described or exemplified in AtomicConnection, or when the user explicitly asks to compare with the reference. Do not "correct" user-approved AtomicConnection deviations back to `ecs-survivors` unless the user asks to revisit that decision.

Before recommending, documenting, or implementing a new lifecycle pattern:

1. Check `AGENTS.md` and existing AtomicConnection code first.
2. If the pattern is not already covered locally, find the matching `ecs-survivors` class/file or concrete pattern.
3. Map that pattern to this project without adding extra architectural layers.
4. If there is no matching pattern in `ecs-survivors`, label it as a new proposal and ask before adding it to docs or code.

Reference-backed lifecycle rules:

- UI may call `GameStateMachine.Enter(...)`, as in `HomeHUD` / `GameOverWindow` from `ecs-survivors`.
- UI may query UI-facing gameplay/meta services and static data for display, as in `LevelUpWindow` and `ShopWindow`.
- Current AtomicConnection decision: gameplay/meta choice UI uses MVP direct service calls for now, not request queues. This is a user-approved simplification from the `ecs-survivors` request-entity pattern.
- UI must not call `SceneLoader.LoadScene(...)` or `SceneLoader.ReloadScene(...)` directly.
- UI must not run gameplay cleanup or control gameplay service lifecycle. Opening/closing gameplay menu may toggle the high-level `PauseService`, but UI must not start, stop, tick, or clean individual gameplay services.
- Runtime gameplay/meta changes from UI should go through high-level feature/domain services, not scattered low-level calls across multiple services.
- Loading states own scene loading.
- Enter/setup states prepare a mode after scene load.
- Active states own update, exit, and cleanup.
- `GameStateMachine` resolves states through `IStateFactory`, which resolves concrete state instances from Zenject, matching `ecs-survivors`.
- Bind states in `ProjectInstaller`; do not manually register state instances into the state machine.
- DI creates and wires objects, but does not decide when gameplay starts.
- Scene initializers write concrete scene references into concrete providers/services.
- Do not add flow services, gameplay runtime/session wrappers, generic scene scopes, lifecycle registries, or other lifecycle-owner abstractions unless the user explicitly asks for a separate proposal.
- Do not add presenter/controller/flow layers as lifecycle intermediaries. Existing UI MVP code may stay where it is already part of the project.

Reference map for common lifecycle/UI decisions:
- `HomeHUD` backs scene HUD flow: UI button calls `IGameStateMachine.Enter(...)` or `IWindowService.Open(...)`.
- `LoadingBattleState` backs loading-state ownership: loading state calls scene loader, then enters setup state.
- `BattleEnterState` backs enter/setup ownership: setup state creates gameplay runtime objects, then enters active loop state.
- `BattleLoopState` backs active loop ownership: active state receives ticks and owns exit cleanup.
- `StateFactory` backs state resolution: state machine asks factory, factory resolves concrete states from Zenject.
- `LevelInitializer` and `UIInitializer` back concrete scene references: scene objects write references into concrete providers/services.
- `WindowService`, `WindowFactory`, `BaseWindow`, `WindowsConfig`, `GameOverWindow`, and `GameOverState` back dynamic window flow.
- `LevelUpWindow`, `ShopWindow`, `UpgradeAbilityOnRequestSystem`, and `BuyItemOnRequestSystem` are the reference for request-based gameplay/meta choice UI, but request transport is deferred in this template.

Reference-backed asset and prefab rules:

- Runtime prefab creation from gameplay states/factories is part of lifecycle and DI work. It must be checked against the full `ecs-survivors` chain, not only against the final `IInstantiator` call.
- The reference chain for gameplay views is: state/domain factory creates gameplay data with a resource path, `IAssetProvider` loads from `Resources`, and a view factory instantiates with Zenject `IInstantiator`.
- Do not replace this with serialized gameplay prefab fields on `ProjectInstaller` unless `ecs-survivors` has the same pattern for that case, or the user explicitly approves it as a new proposal.
- A partial API match is not enough. If only `InstantiatePrefabForComponent(...)` matches but asset ownership/loading differs, call it out as a mismatch before changing code or docs.
- Do not copy ECS-only service dependencies such as `GameEntity`, generated contexts, or `ICollisionRegistry` into this template. When a reference service depends on ECS, keep only the lifecycle/DI placement and adapt the service API to Unity-neutral types.

Service lifecycle rule:

```text
State decides when.
Service knows how.
```

If a service is passive, do not add lifecycle methods to it. If a service owns subscriptions, timers, spawn loops, input modes, async tasks, or update work, expose explicit methods such as `Start`, `Stop`, `Enable`, `Disable`, `Update`, or `Cleanup`, and call them from the owning state.

### Architecture workflow

- `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for current architecture rules.
- `LIFECYCLE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` is a historical migration/audit log, not the active task plan. Do not add new work there unless the user explicitly reopens migration planning.
- Keep new or undocumented lifecycle decisions reference-backed by `ecs-survivors`; if a needed decision is neither covered locally nor reference-backed, stop and present it as a separate proposal.
- After each architecture/lifecycle/UI/DI slice, check whether `AGENTS.md` still matches the implemented architecture. Update it before the final response if current flow, state registration, lifecycle rules, or project conventions changed.

### Core patterns

**State Machine** controls game flow. State machine implementations live in `Infrastructure/GameStates/StateMachine/`, state interfaces and base helpers live in `Infrastructure/GameStates/StateInfrastructure/`, state resolution lives in `Infrastructure/GameStates/Factory/`, and concrete lifecycle states live in `Infrastructure/GameStates/States/`. Current flow is `BootstrapState -> LoadMainMenuState -> MainMenuState -> LoadGameplayState -> GameplayEnterState -> GameplayState`. `GameplayPauseState` and `GameOverOrParagonState` are registered lifecycle states for later transitions. Do not enter `GameplayPauseState` for the gear menu until `GameplayState` has explicit suspend/resume semantics; a normal state transition out of `GameplayState` runs cleanup.

Each state implements `IState, IGameState` directly or inherits a base state that does. Bind every lifecycle state in `ProjectInstaller` with self binding, resolve states through `IStateFactory`, transition with `_stateMachine.Enter<SomeState>()`, and keep scene loading inside loading states.

States are lifecycle orchestrators, not gameplay logic containers. A state may
load scenes, create initial runtime objects through factories, start services,
call service `Update`/`Cleanup`/`Cancel` methods, gate those calls with pause or
state-transition conditions, and transition to another state. A state must not
contain gameplay mechanics or algorithms: no input-processing branches, drag/drop
rules, click/spawn progress, target selection, timers/cooldowns, physics queries,
damage/resource/score mutation, or UI choice application logic. Put that logic
inside the owning service, then call the service from the state. Keep this rule
even when the code looks small enough for a private state helper method.

`GameplayEnterState` owns the current gameplay setup: it reads `ILevelStartPointProvider.StartPoint`, calls `IAtomCoreFactory.Create(...)`, creates the battle molecule, then enters `GameplayState`. `AtomCoreFactory`, `FreeAtomFactory`, and `BattleMoleculeFactory` follow the reference-backed prefab flow: `Resources` paths under `Gameplay/Units/...` -> `IAssetProvider` -> Zenject `IInstantiator`, mirroring `HeroFactory.AddViewPath("Gameplay/Hero/hero")` and `EntityViewFactory.CreateViewForEntity(...)` in `ecs-survivors`. `GameplayState` inherits `EndOfFrameExitState`; it starts/ticks/cleans active gameplay services such as `IEnemySpawner` and `IAtomCoreClickService`, skips gameplay ticks while `PauseService.IsPaused`, and its `ExitOnEndOfFrame()` calls cleanup for state-owned runtime objects. `EnemySpawner`, `IAtomCoreClickService`, and battle molecule setup read tunable numeric values from config assets assigned in `GlobalConfigInstaller`. Do not use serialized gameplay prefab fields on `ProjectInstaller` for runtime gameplay prefabs unless explicitly approved as a new proposal. `GameplaySceneInitializer` writes the `MainCamera` and `GameplayStartPoint` scene references into `CameraProvider` and `LevelStartPointProvider`.

Scene initializers that implement Zenject interfaces must be listed in `SceneInitializationInstaller` on the scene `SceneContext`, matching the `ecs-survivors` pattern.

**Window Flow** follows the reference-backed dynamic window path:
`WindowService.Open(WindowId)` -> `WindowFactory.CreateWindow(...)` ->
`WindowsConfig` prefab lookup at `Resources/Configs/Windows/windowConfig` ->
Zenject `IInstantiator` under the scene `UIRoot`. `UIInitializer` writes the
scene `Canvas`/`UIRoot` into `WindowFactory` through `SceneInitializationInstaller`.
`SettingsView` is now a `BaseWindow` opened by `MainMenuHud` through
`WindowService.Open(WindowId.SettingsWindow)`. In `Gameplay`, the scene-owned
HUD `GearButton` sets `PauseService.SetPaused(true)` and opens the dynamic
`WindowId.GameplayMenuWindow`; `GameplayMenuWindow` backs that gameplay menu modal and
unpauses before close/restart/main-menu actions. This is not a result/game-over
window, and `GameOverOrParagonState` must not open it unless explicitly
redesigned. Do not inject concrete windows such as `SettingsView` directly into
menu UI.

**Gameplay Menu Pause** is not a `GameplayPauseState` transition yet.
`GearButton -> PauseService.SetPaused(true) -> WindowService.Open(WindowId.GameplayMenuWindow)`.
`Close`, `Restart`, and `MainMenu` actions in `GameplayMenuWindow` must unpause first; loading states
also reset pause as a safety measure. `GameplayState` skips active gameplay
ticks while `PauseService.IsPaused`, but keeps state-owned runtime objects alive.
No gameplay-changing path may bypass this pause gate. Input polling, timers,
cooldowns, spawning, resource changes, score/progress changes, and other runtime
gameplay mutations must run from services ticked by `GameplayState`, not from
independent `MonoBehaviour.Update()` methods.

**Gameplay Input and Interaction** belongs to the active gameplay loop when it
can change runtime state. Click-to-spawn, selection, targeting, charge bars, and
similar interactions should be modeled as state-owned services with explicit
`Start`, `Update`, `Cancel`/`Stop`, and `Cleanup` methods as needed. Keep simple
interaction mechanics inside the existing owning service instead of adding
wrapper services. Current drag/drop ownership is `DragService`: it reads input
and camera data, starts/moves/ends drag, handles raw release for active drags,
and is ticked from `GameplayState`. Do not put drag mechanics into
`GameplayState`, and do not add a separate drag interaction service unless
`DragService` has become genuinely too broad and the user approves the split.
`MonoBehaviour` runtime components may expose passive methods such as
`SetProgress`, `OnDragMove`, or collision/view callbacks, but they should not
poll input or spawn/clean gameplay objects on their own. UI-filtered input is
appropriate for starting clicks/drags; release/cancel for an already-started
drag must use raw input so the interaction cannot get stuck when the pointer is
over UI. Any `EventSystem.current` access must be null-checked.

**Zenject DI** wires dependencies. No `new SomeService()` for DI-owned services - bind them in installers and inject them. `IInitializable` is allowed for local setup, UI presenters, settings, cached references, and other non-flow initialization. Do not use `IInitializable` to enter gameplay states, load gameplay scenes, or start active gameplay loops.

**Config Assets vs Prefab Registries** are intentionally different. Value/config
assets with gameplay or settings numbers should be assigned in installers,
bound with `FromInstance(...)`, and injected; `EnemySpawnerConfig` is the current
example. Dynamic prefab registries that map ids to prefabs may stay
resource-backed, matching `ecs-survivors` `WindowsConfig`/`StaticDataService`
lookup. `WindowsConfig` is a prefab registry, not a numeric settings config.
When adding a new value config, create the asset under `Assets/_Project/Data/Config`,
add a serialized auto-property to `GlobalConfigInstaller`, bind it with
`FromInstance(...)`, and inject the config into the owning service.

Three installer types:
- `MonoInstaller` - scene-bound, serialized fields for Unity references
- `ScriptableObjectInstaller` - asset-based config (e.g. `GlobalConfigInstaller`)
- Installers in `ProjectContext` apply project-wide; scene `GameObjectContext`/`SceneContext` are local

**MVP** used for UI: `Model` (data + PlayerPrefs), `Presenter` (`IInitializable`, UI/local logic), `View` (MonoBehaviour, UI only). See `Audio/` for the canonical example. Presenters must not become lifecycle intermediaries for gameplay flow.

**Gameplay choice UI** uses MVP direct service calls for now. Presenters/windows may read display data from services/static data and may call high-level feature/domain methods such as `BuyItem(id)`, `SelectUpgrade(id)`, or `ApplyChoice(id)` directly. Keep the operation encapsulated in one owning service; do not spread one UI click across low-level calls such as `RemoveGold`, `AddPurchasedItem`, `ApplyBoost`, and `SaveProgress` from the presenter. The `ecs-survivors` request pattern (`UpgradeRequest`/`BuyRequest` entities processed later by systems) is documented as a deferred option, not the current default.

**Deferred request transport** may be reconsidered later if direct service calls cause real problems: multiple UI entry points apply the same effect differently, strict ordering inside the active gameplay/meta loop matters, close/pause/state transitions conflict with direct calls, or choices need to be logged/tested separately from their effects. If this returns, do not add an abstract event bus by default; model it as a named request transport owned by the feature, then process it from the owning gameplay/meta loop.

**Repositories** - inherit `Repository<T> : ScriptableObject` where `T : Definition` for any game data. Bind with `FromInstance()` in an installer.

**UniTask** for all async and time-based operations. Coroutines are **never** used, including Unity yield instructions such as `WaitForSeconds`, `UnityEngine.WaitUntil`, and similar. Use `UniTask.Delay`, `UniTask.WaitUntil`, `async UniTaskVoid` instead. This applies to all code: MonoBehaviour components, services, states.

**Component-based approach** - runtime Unity objects are built from small `MonoBehaviour` components. One responsibility equals one component. Dependencies between gameplay components should use `[SerializeField]` or `GetComponent`, not Zenject. State-owned lifecycle helpers such as factories, spawners, input handlers, and click/progress services can be plain DI services that are started, updated, cancelled/stopped, and cleaned by states. Do not inject gameplay services, factories, config, or input into a runtime `MonoBehaviour` just so that component can own active gameplay flow; inject those dependencies into the owning state/service instead and keep the component passive.

### Adding new things

**New gameplay feature:**
1. Create a `Gameplay/FeatureName/` folder.
2. Put runtime object behavior into focused `MonoBehaviour` components.
3. If the feature polls input, advances timers/cooldowns, spawns or cleans objects, or changes gameplay progress/resources, put that logic in a plain DI service ticked by the owning state.
4. Put factories/spawners/lifecycle helpers in the same feature folder as plain DI services when a state owns their lifecycle.
5. If the feature needs ScriptableObject data, create a `GameplayData/Definitions/FeatureName/` folder.

**New service:**
1. Define the interface beside the feature/service implementation, or in the relevant `Domain/` folder for subsystems that already use one.
2. Implement the class.
3. Bind in an installer with `Container.Bind<IMyService>().To<MyService>().AsSingle()` or `Container.BindInterfacesAndSelfTo<MyService>().AsSingle()` when self binding is also needed.
4. If the service has active lifecycle, call its explicit lifecycle methods from a state.
5. Inject via `[Inject]`.

**New value config:**
1. Create a `ScriptableObject` config with serialized auto-properties.
2. Place the asset in `Assets/_Project/Data/Config`.
3. Add it to `GlobalConfigInstaller` as a serialized auto-property.
4. Bind it with `FromInstance(...)` through the shared config binding helper.
5. Inject it into the service that owns the behavior.

**New prefab registry:**
1. Use this only for dynamic prefab lookup by id/path, not for gameplay tuning numbers.
2. Keep it resource-backed when it mirrors `WindowsConfig`/`StaticDataService` from `ecs-survivors`.
3. Document the lookup path and keep every enum id mapped to a prefab.

**New game state:**
1. `public class MyState : IState, IGameState`
2. Implement `Enter()` and `Exit()`
3. Implement update only when the state owns an active loop
4. Add `Container.BindInterfacesAndSelfTo<MyState>().AsSingle()` in `ProjectInstaller`
5. Transition: `_stateMachine.Enter<MyState>()`

**New gameplay data:**
1. `public class MyDef : Definition { }`
2. `public class MyRepo : Repository<MyDef> { }` with `[CreateAssetMenu]`
3. Bind in `RepositoryInstaller`

## Coding conventions

| Element | Convention |
|---|---|
| Private fields | `_camelCase` |
| Constants | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` |
| Interfaces | `IPascalCase` |
| Properties | `PascalCase`, `private set` |
| Namespaces | Mirror directory path |

- Use field injection for Zenject dependencies. Prefer `[Inject] private SomeService _service;` over constructor injection.
- Use serialized auto-properties for inspector-exposed fields: `[field: SerializeField] private GameObject Obj { get; set; }`. Do not add new `[SerializeField] private GameObject _obj;` fields.
- When converting existing serialized fields to serialized auto-properties, update scene/prefab YAML references to the backing field name, for example `<Obj>k__BackingField`.
- Prefer `List<T>` over arrays (`T[]`) where possible, including `[field: SerializeField]` collections
- For new files, prefer usings grouped as System -> UnityEngine -> third-party -> project. In existing files, keep the surrounding order unless the file is already being cleaned up.

## Validation

- When possible, validate Unity changes by opening the project in Unity `6000.4.4f1`.
- For code-only changes, at minimum check affected C# files for compile-time issues and keep scene/prefab references in sync.
- If adding or moving Unity assets, ensure corresponding `.meta` files are present and Unity-valid. Script `.cs.meta` files should contain a `MonoImporter` block, folder `.meta` files should contain `folderAsset: yes` and `DefaultImporter`, and new/moved prefabs or assets must keep stable GUID references. Prefer letting Unity generate or refresh these files when possible.
- Current manual lifecycle/UI validation should include `MainMenu -> Settings -> Apply/Cancel`, `MainMenu -> Gameplay`, `GearButton -> GameplayMenuWindow -> Close`, `GearButton -> GameplayMenuWindow -> Restart`, and `GearButton -> GameplayMenuWindow -> MainMenu`.
- Current gameplay validation should include `Bootstrap -> LoadMainMenuState -> MainMenuState -> LoadGameplayState -> GameplayEnterState -> GameplayState`, `AtomCore` creation at `GameplayStartPoint`, enemy spawning after first gameplay click, and cleanup when restarting or returning to main menu.

## Git Notes

- Git may report `dubious ownership` in sandboxed environments. Use a per-command safe directory override when inspecting status:
  `git -c safe.directory=F:/unity_personal/Jams/gamedevtv-jam-2026-atomic_connection status --short --branch`
- Do not create commits, branches, stage files, or rewrite history unless the user asks for that explicitly.
